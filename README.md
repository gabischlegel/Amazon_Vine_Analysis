# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16
## Overview 
In this project I analyzed Amazon reviews for watches written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, youâ€™ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

## Results
There were 43 Vine reviews and 7750 non-Vine reviews.

There were 14 five-star Vine reviews and 4027 five-star non-Vine reviews.

32.56% of the Vine reviews were five stars while 51.96% of non-Vine reviews were five stars.

## Summary 
Per this analysis, there was no positivity bias for the Vine program. The program only came out with an 32.55% of the total reviews being five-star reviews. There were only 14 five-star reviews that were through the Vine program and only 43 Vine program reviews in total. The non-Vine reviews were more positive as 51.96% of the total reviews were five-star reviews. There was a of 7750 five-star reviews that were not through the Vine program and 4027 non-Vine reviews in total. I would perform an additional analysis to see the quantity and percentage of 1-star reviews in the Vine program and in the non-Vine program. This was we could see if the Vine program does not feel comfortable giving 1-star reviews.
